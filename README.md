This project is a front-end implementation of Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search, developed as part of the HarvardX CS50 Web Programming course. The website consists of three key pages:

Google Search (index.html): A page that mimics the basic functionality and aesthetics of Google's main search engine, allowing users to enter a query and see results.
Google Image Search: A page dedicated to searching images, following the design and feel of Google Images.
Google Advanced Search: A more detailed search form allowing users to refine their queries with additional parameters.
Key Features:
Clean and minimal design inspired by Google.
Functional search links between all pages.
CSS styling closely resembling the Google interface.
This project showcases skills in front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
